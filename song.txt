Humanity
Auf wiedersehen
It´s time to say goodbye
The party´s over
As the laughter dies
An angel cries

Humanity
It´s au revoir to your insanity
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies

You´re a drop in the rain
Just a number not a name
And you don´t see it
You don´t believe it
At the end of the day
You´re a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you gotta deal with it
Humanity
Humanity
Goodbye
Goodbye
